I had to do some changes to the apps that they actually create a new hash or initialize pongs only if the files do not exists or they are empty.
I tested that it worked also on the browser and that the files were persistent. I had some problems with the storageClassName first before
I found that it was on diifferent name on my system. I found out that one can also do some of them by oneself. There was also a huge problem with accessmodes, 
as I changed it first to ReadWriteMany in the persistentvolume.yaml just to find out later, that it is in this case probably the reason why I do no get the whole thing working.
