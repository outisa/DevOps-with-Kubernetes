I changed deployment.yaml to foolowing:
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hashgenerator-dep
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hashgenerator
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hashgenerator
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: shared-logs
          emptyDir: {}
      containers:
        - name: main-app-finder
          image: outisa/main-application-finder:745cdec5c459a7ced3eb64e6886af77006ead75f
          volumeMounts:
          - name: shared-logs          
            mountPath: /app/files
        - name: main-app-generator
          image: outisa/main-application-generator:745cdec5c459a7ced3eb64e6886af77006ead75f
          volumeMounts:
            - name: shared-logs
              mountPath: /app/files
```
And run following commands (as everything was configured right):

```
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/outisa/kubernetes-mainApp/master/manifests/deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/hashgenerator-dep created
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pingpong-dep-5c4c6784d7-5hhst        1/1     Running   3          23h
hashgenerator-dep-5744c486b4-xnnqf   2/2     Running   0          7m2s
```
I did not get everything right at first time, as I let same port for both of apps. Lens was again a perfect tool to find out the problem. I also checked from the browser, that the file content was shown.
