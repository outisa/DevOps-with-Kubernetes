I modified service.yaml to use loadbalancer:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: pingpong-svc
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: pingpong
  ports:
    - port: 80
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 3002
```
I removed namespace attribute from all the yaml files.
(They can be found here)[https://github.com/outisa/kubernetes-pingpong/tree/master/manifests]

I also had to add subPath configuration as introduced in the exercise.
After this applying the configuration files I could see the pongs on the browser in json format (as they are sended).
