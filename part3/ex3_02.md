I modifed ingress.yaml file as follows
```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: dwk-material-ing
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: hashgenerator-svc
          servicePort: 80
      - path: /pingpong
        backend:
          serviceName: pingpong-svc
          servicePort: 80
```
And changed type on both service.yaml file to NodePort.
Funny part is, that pingpong app is constatly pinged, as pongs increases all the time even though the browser is not refreshed.

Both applications at this moment.
