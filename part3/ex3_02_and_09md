I modifed hashgenerator ingress.yaml file as follows
```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: dwk-material-ing
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: hashgenerator-svc
          servicePort: 80
```
and pingpong yaml file as follows
```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: pingpong-ing
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /pingpong
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /pingpong
        backend:
          serviceName: pingpong-backend-svc
          servicePort: 80

```
And changed type on both service.yaml file to NodePort.
Funny part is, that pingpong app is constatly pinged, as pongs increases all the time even though the browser is not refreshed.

Both applications at this moment.

Ex. 3.09 I tested that scaling works. Memory with 45Mi caused all 6 replicas to run, so changed it back to 50Mi.
