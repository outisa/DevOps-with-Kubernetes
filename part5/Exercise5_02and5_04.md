Exercise 5.02:

[App now](https://github.com/outisa/kubernetes-todo-app) with linknerd injection in the deployment.yamls. I also fixed one image related error, which could exist when there is no image yet. I thought I had fixed it already, but the same error occured today after deleting the cluster and by recreating a new one.

Exercise 5.04:

I am comparing Rancher and OpenShift. I would choose Rancher for now as it:

* It is free to use also in production. OpenShift has only free tiers to development and testing.
* One need only from couple of ten minutes to the couple of hours install Rancher. However, it can take days to install Openshift completely.
* Rancher get automatically updates between versions, OpenShift does not according to source (however, one can add operator framework to do that).
* In OpenShift desicions are made for you so you have limited options to use. By using Rancher one does decisions by oneself.
* Because of the previous point, you learn much more by using Rancher.
* Rancher offers online training.
* Rancher is Rancher, if one choose OpenShift on must decide which kind of 'package' one have and whom one pay for services.
* I liked Rancher websites than OpenShift.
