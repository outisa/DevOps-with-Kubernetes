I made this perhaps a little stupid as I wrote the url direct to the sh file. It may have been wiser to pass as an argument as it eas done in the backup example.
I tested that cron job creates a job and the result is the right one by triggering it manually and setting the scheduling first to every two minutes.
After I saw this working I changes it to schedule the job every day at 8.
